Welcome to the onichan!
===================================

I'm **onichan**. I'm a developer. I'm interested in making Minecraft servers and plugins, making Discord bots and Python language. In my free times, I'm creating Minecraft servers and deleting them. This is my hobby.

You can contact me by going to the :doc:`contact` section.

.. note::

   I'm not professional at coding. I do it as hobby.
